Mainly scripts to run with CERN ROOT.

/***
    * HOW TO USE  
    *   
    * Data files on data/ folder, you need to copy the path to the file starting there.  
    * To get graph output, run $root scripts/<name of file>.cpp  
    * 
    * Change axis name and graph title;
    * To print data, print = 1;  
    * To save graph, save = 1;  
    * To fit to data, fit = 1;  
    * Change function to fit using string fit_function
    * 
    * Output saved in bin/ directory, possible to change it in dir variable.
